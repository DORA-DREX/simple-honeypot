# 🎬 Honeypot Demonstration Guide

This guide walks you through a complete demonstration of the honeypot system, showing exactly what happens at each step.

## 🎯 Demo Overview

**What we'll demonstrate:**
1. Starting the honeypot server
2. Accessing the fake login page
3. Making login attempts (simulating an attacker)

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Demonstration

### Step 1: Start the Honeypot Server

**Open terminal and run:**
```bash
cd simple-honeypot
python honeypot_server.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🍯 Simple Honeypot Server
========================================
Starting server on port 8080
Logs will be saved to: logs/
Access the honeypot at: http://localhost:8080

⚠️  EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY - Use responsibly!
========================================

🚀 Server running! Visit http://localhost:8080
Press Ctrl+C to stop the server
```

**✅ Success indicators:**
- No error messages
- Server shows "running" status
- Port 8080 is accessible

### Step 2: Access the Honeypot

**Open web browser and navigate to:**
```
http://localhost:8080
```

**What you should see:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     🏢 ADMIN PORTAL             │
│   Secure Administrative Access │
│                                 │
│  👤 Username: [____________]    │
│  🔒 Password: [____________]    │
│                                 │
│         [🔐 LOGIN]              │
│                                 │
│  ⚠️  WARNING: Authorized        │
│     Personnel Only              │
└─────────────────────────────────┐
```

**✅ Success indicators:**
- Professional-looking login page
- Form fields are functional
- Warning message is visible
- Page loads without errors

### Step 3: Simulate Attack Attempts

**Now we'll simulate what an attacker might try:**

#### Attempt 1: Common Default Credentials
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `password`
- **Click:** LOGIN button

**What happens:**
1. Loading spinner appears (2 seconds)
2. "Login Failed" error message shows
3. Password field clears
4. Focus returns to username field

#### Attempt 2: Another Common Combination
- **Username:** `administrator`
- **Password:** `123456`
- **Click:** LOGIN button

**Same behavior:** Always fails, maintains deception

#### Attempt 3: Root Access Attempt
- **Username:** `root`
- **Password:** `admin`
- **Click:** LOGIN button

**Check the server terminal:**
You should see real-time logging like:
```
🍯 HONEYPOT CAPTURE!
Time: 2025-08-01T09:15:23.456Z
IP: 127.0.0.1
Username: admin
Password: password
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)...
--------------------------------------------------
```

### Step 4: View Captured Data

**Open a new terminal window (keep server running):**
```bash
cd simple-honeypot
python view_logs.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
🍯 Simple Honeypot Log Viewer
========================================
📊 HONEYPOT SUMMARY

🔤 Most common usernames:
  • admin: 1 attempts
  • administrator: 1 attempts
  • root: 1 attempts

🔐 Most common passwords:
  • password: 1 attempts
  • 123456: 1 attempts
  • admin: 1 attempts

⏰ Time range:
  First attempt: 2025-08-01T09:15:23.456Z
  Last attempt: 2025-08-01T09:17:45.123Z

📋 DETAILED LOGS (showing last 3 attempts)

### Step 5: Examine Log Files

**Check the raw log files:**
```bash
# View human-readable logs
type logs\honeypot_attempts.log

# View JSON logs (Windows)
type logs\honeypot_attempts.json

# On Linux/Mac use 'cat' instead of 'type'
```

**Sample log file content:**
```

## 🎭 Advanced Demo Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Persistent Attacker
**Simulate someone who won't give up:**
1. Try `admin/password` - fails
2. Try `admin/admin` - fails  
3. Try `admin/123456` - fails
4. Try `admin/password123` - fails
5. Try `admin/qwerty` - fails

**Show the pattern analysis:**
```bash
python view_logs.py
```

**Point out:**
- Multiple attempts from same IP
- Password variations being tried
- Persistence of the attacker

### Scenario 2: Multiple "Attackers"
**Use different browsers or incognito mode:**
1. **Chrome:** Try `administrator/password`
2. **Firefox:** Try `root/toor`
3. **Edge:** Try `guest/guest`

**Show the diversity:**
- Different user agents captured
- Various username attempts
- Browser fingerprinting data

### Scenario 3: Brute Force Simulation
**Rapid-fire attempts:**
1. `admin/password`
2. `admin/123456`
3. `admin/admin`
4. `admin/letmein`
5. `admin/welcome`

**Demonstrate:**
- Time clustering in logs
- Automated attack patterns
- How real attacks might look
