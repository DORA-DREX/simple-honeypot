This honeypot is designed for **educational purposes only**. Following these guidelines ensures you learn safely and legally.

## üü¢ Legal and Safe Uses

### ‚úÖ Educational Learning
- **Personal study** of cybersecurity concepts
- **Classroom demonstrations** with proper supervision
- **Understanding attack patterns** in controlled environments
- **Learning network security monitoring**

### ‚úÖ Authorized Testing
- **Your own devices** and networks
- **Lab environments** set up for learning
- **Isolated test networks** with no real data
- **Supervised educational settings**

### ‚úÖ Professional Development
- **Cybersecurity training** programs
- **Security awareness** demonstrations
- **Understanding honeypot technology** for defense
- **Learning incident response** procedures

## üî¥ Illegal and Dangerous Uses

### ‚ùå Never Do This
- **Deploy on networks you don't own** - This is illegal
- **Use on public networks** - Violates terms of service
- **Capture real user credentials** - Privacy violation
- **Use for malicious purposes** - Criminal activity

### ‚ùå Avoid These Scenarios
- **Corporate networks without permission** - Could get you fired/arrested
- **School networks without authorization** - Academic misconduct
- **Public Wi-Fi or shared networks** - Legal liability
- **Any system with real users** - Ethical violation

## üîí Technical Safety Measures

### Built-in Protections
```
‚úÖ Local-only by default (localhost:8080)
‚úÖ No real authentication bypass
‚úÖ Isolated from other systems
‚úÖ Logs stored locally only
‚úÖ No network propagation capability
```

### Additional Safety Steps

#### 1. Network Isolation
```bash
# Only bind to localhost (default)
# Never change to 0.0.0.0 without understanding implications
python honeypot_server.py  # Safe: localhost only
```

#### 2. Firewall Configuration
```bash
# Ensure your firewall blocks external access
# Windows: Check Windows Defender Firewall
# Linux: Use iptables or ufw
# macOS: Check System Preferences > Security
```

#### 3. Virtual Machine Usage
```
Recommended: Run in a VM for extra isolation
- VirtualBox, VMware, or Hyper-V
- Snapshot before testing
- Network set to "Host-only" or "NAT"
- No shared folders with sensitive data
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist
